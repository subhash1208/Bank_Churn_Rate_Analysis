# EDA
**
First Project is EDA of CreditCard Data found on Kaggle. - [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers]**
   We had first cleaned up missing Data and changed any object type variables to categorical variables and then we have done Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA] 
   on the given data set to find a few facts about the data such as:
	
       1. We created a correlation matrix on a sns heatmap and besd on that we performed analysis on a few variables
		 
       2. Customer Age v/s Total Transaction Amount v/s Average Utilization Ratio
		 
       3. Gender vs Income Categories
		 
       4. Total Transaction Amount vs Various Features
		 
       5. Distribution Of Total Transaction Amount
		 
       6. Education_Level vs Months_On_Book vs Transaction_Value

	
   After doing some EDA and coming to a few conclusions in which have been mentioned in the file, I have tried out a few ML Models to predict the attrition 
   rate given the following mentioned parameters. After Analysing all models I have arrived at the best suitable model for predicting the attrition rate
